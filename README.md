This is a practice project for JavaScript and Boostrap. The goal was to create a front-end for a web wallet for the cryptocurrency ADA (Cardano). The Wallet is NOT functional and NOT intended to be functional. It creates test addresses and you can only use it to send FAKE ADA from Wallet 1 to Wallet 2, or into Nirvana. 
Since this is only a small Front-End practice project, there is no backend or database. When the page is refreshed, everything will return to default values.

Disclaimer: If you send real ADA to the generated addresses, you will lose them. I am not to be charged for any losses.

That said, have fun! ;)
